// This is a simple Go program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// It demonstrates the basic structure of a Go program, including the main package and the main function.
// The main function is the entry point of the program, and the fmt package is used for formatted I/O.
// The Println function is used to print the string to the console, followed by a newline character.
